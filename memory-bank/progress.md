# Progress

## Current Status
**Project Phase**: Range Builder Implementation - Core Mechanics Complete
**Date Started**: 2025-08-13
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-14

## What Works

### Solver Integration (Complete)
- **COMPLETE postflop-solver Rust code integrated** (2025-08-13)
- **Native Node.js bindings created** for maximum performance
- **Electron configured** for desktop deployment
- **Native solver module COMPILED and TESTED** - Successfully solving poker games
- **Electron IPC handlers implemented** - Full solver integration with main process

### Range Builder (Partially Complete)
- **Action Sequence Timeline** - Visual poker decision tree with drag navigation
- **Dynamic Position Cards** - Shows available actions for each position
- **Smart Gap-Filling** - Auto check/fold for skipped positions
- **Multi-Betting Cycles** - Supports unlimited betting rounds
- **Index-Based Card System** - Proper tracking of multiple actions per position
- **BB Special Logic** - BB only appears when someone limps/raises
- **Proper Betting Logic** - All-in handling, stack-aware betting options
- **Paint Tool** - Working range frequency painting
- **Table Settings UI** - Complete settings panel (but not integrated)

## What's Been Built

### Project Infrastructure
- Unified project structure (Frontend + API + Electron)
- Memory bank documentation system
- TypeScript build system working
- Full postflop-solver integration with native bindings

### Range Builder Components
1. **PokerGameEngine** - Centralized game logic
   - Complete betting round detection
   - Proper position ordering (HJ first in preflop)
   - Stack-aware action generation
   - NO automatic street advancement (deliberate design)

2. **ActionSequenceBar** - Timeline visualization
   - Index-based cards (not position-based)
   - Proper past/current/future status tracking
   - Drag navigation for long sequences
   - Dynamic height based on available actions

3. **Game Tree Structure**
   - ActionNodes with complete state snapshots
   - Range storage at each node
   - Parent-child navigation
   - Saved available actions (no recalculation)

## What Doesn't Work Yet

### Critical Missing Features
1. **Table Settings Integration** - Settings exist but don't affect game simulation
2. **Range Persistence** - Ranges don't save between actions or sessions
3. **Range Initialization Sliders** - Were removed, need to be restored
4. **Position Selection** - Can't click position to view/edit range without selecting action
5. **Postflop Continuation** - Stops at preflop, doesn't continue to flop/turn/river
6. **Board Cards** - No way to select flop/turn/river cards
7. **Range Library** - No connection between tree and range library system

### Known Issues
- Range data at nodes isn't properly propagated through tree
- "Save Range" button saves entire tree, not individual ranges
- Can't manually construct ranges for specific positions/actions
- Tree represents library of ranges but linkage not implemented

## What's Left to Build

### Immediate Priority (Range Builder Completion)
- [ ] Integrate table settings with game engine
- [ ] Restore range initialization sliders
- [ ] Implement range persistence within session
- [ ] Add position selection without action requirement
- [ ] Enable manual range construction for any position/action
- [ ] Link range tree to library system
- [ ] Extend simulation beyond preflop to all streets
- [ ] Add board card selection for postflop

### Solver Integration
- [ ] Connect ranges to existing solver
- [ ] Handle missing tree paths
- [ ] Build solver UI for postflop analysis
- [ ] Implement range propagation through tree

### Training System
- [ ] Hand history parser
- [ ] Population range construction
- [ ] Drill mode implementation
- [ ] Progress tracking

## Evolution of Decisions

### Range Builder Architecture
1. **Initial**: Simple action sequence tracking
2. **Problem**: State retroactively changed when editing
3. **Solution**: Complete state snapshots at each node

### Timeline Design
1. **Initial**: Position-based cards
2. **Problem**: Multiple actions per position caused confusion
3. **Solution**: Index-based cards with unique IDs

### BB Visibility
1. **Initial**: BB always visible
2. **Realization**: BB shouldn't act if everyone folds
3. **Solution**: BB only appears after someone acts (limps/raises)

## Technical Achievements
- O(N) timeline processing (was O(N²))
- Proper all-in handling with stack awareness
- Smart decimal formatting (100 not 100.0, but keeps 99.5)
- Clean action labels without redundant "BB" suffix
- Elegant BB edge case handling without hardcoding

## Next Actions
1. **Connect table settings to game engine** - Make settings actually affect gameplay
2. **Restore range sliders** - Bring back quick initialization tools
3. **Implement range persistence** - Save ranges at each node
4. **Add position click handler** - View/edit ranges without action selection
5. **Extend to postflop** - Continue simulation through all streets
6. **Add board card selection** - UI for choosing flop/turn/river

## Performance Notes
- Timeline renders smoothly with 20+ actions
- Drag navigation working well
- No performance issues with current implementation
- Ready for solver integration once ranges persist
