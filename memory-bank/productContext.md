# Product Context

## Why This Product Exists

### Personal Motivation
This project stems from a personal need to improve at poker through better training tools. Current solutions are either:
- Too expensive (GTO Wizard at $39-100/month)
- Have terrible UX (PioSolver's complex interface)
- Lack population-based training
- Don't offer competitive practice environments

### Market Gap
Despite poker's popularity, quality training software remains either inaccessible or unusable for most players. This creates an opportunity for a tool that combines:
- Professional-grade solver capabilities
- Consumer-friendly interface
- Comprehensive training features
- Social competitive elements
